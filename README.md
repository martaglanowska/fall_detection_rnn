# Fall detection from accelerometer data using Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository is supplementary to the paper on fall detection using accelerometer data from a smartphone.

## Requirements
* Python (v3.9.16)
* Tensorflow (v2.10.1)
* GPU (recommended)

## Contents

* `Fall Detection Study based on RNNs.ipynb` notebook contains the model implementations and results of our experiments.
* `UniMiB-SHAR` folder contains the dataset used for the experiments (see http://www.sal.disco.unimib.it/technologies/unimib-shar/ for more details)
* `charts.ipynb` notebook contains codes used to generate charts used in our paper
